//Step 1 (Establish the connection)
        //Create empty connection object
        SqlConnection objConn = new SqlConnection("data source = DESKTOP-BVTLLAS\\SQLEXPRESS; initial catalog = AddressBook; Integrated Security = True;");
        //objConn.ConnectionString = "data source = DESKTOP-BVTLLAS\\SQLEXPRESS; initial catalog = AddressBook; Integrated Security = True";
        //data source = DESKTOP-480B182\SQLEXPRESS; This is the source of the Data/Server Name.
        //initial catalog = AddressBook; This is the name of the Database.
        //Integrated Security = True; if it's True then consider as Windows Authentication. In case of False SQL authentication needs to be mentioned like;
        //User ID = abc
        //Password = aaa

        objConn.Open(); //Open the connection
        //Do your data related work.

        //Step 2 (Prepare the Command object)
        SqlCommand objCmd = objConn.CreateCommand();
        //SqlCommand objCmd = new SqlCommand();
        // objCmd.Connection = objConn;
        objCmd.CommandType = CommandType.StoredProcedure;
        //objCmd.CommandType = CommandType.Text;
        //objCmd.CommandType = CommandType.TableDirect;
        objCmd.CommandText = "PR_Country_SelectAll";

        //objCmd.ExecuteNonQuery();     for INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
        //objCmd.ExecuteReader();       for SELECT
        //objCmd.ExecuteScalar();       here only one Scalar value is being returned
        //objCmd.ExecuteXMLReader();    for XML type of data

        SqlDataReader objSDR = objCmd.ExecuteReader();
        gvCountry.DataSource = objSDR;
        gvCountry.DataBind();

        objConn.Close(); //Close the connection
